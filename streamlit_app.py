> *‚ÄúThousands of miles, countless steps, and a rollercoaster of emotions.‚Äù*

The Appalachian Trail is more than a physical journey‚Äîit's an emotional odyssey through forests, friendships, and fatigue. 
Long-distance hikers often share their stories online, posting blog entries that capture their mental highs and lows across the 2,190+ mile trek.

In this project, we explore how emotional well-being is shaped by **social interactions**, **geographical locations**, and **trail conditions**. 
By using **AI-driven sentiment analysis** on a decade of hiker journal entries, we uncover where hikers felt joy, where they struggled, 
and how ‚Äútrail magic‚Äù‚Äîunexpected kindness‚Äîlifted spirits along the way.

The data source for our project is the [Trail Journals Platform]({url}), an online community-driven website where hikers document their experiences while hiking 
long-distance trails. This platform offers rich, narrative accounts that encapsulate hikers' emotional responses, social interactions, opinions, and behaviors 
on the trail. The data used for analysis only includes Appalachian Trail long-distance hikers, defined as hikers who have at least hiked 100 miles on the same 
trail within a month. The dataset spans from 2013 to 2023 and includes:
- 987 hikers
- 232,143 individual journal entries

        Emotional well-being is vital for individuals experiencing a life transition journey, 
        as it helps them maintain resilience, stay focused, and inform their decision-making. 

        Given the increasing integration of technology into everyday life, even in natural settings, 
        individuals share their experiences in online media, especially community-centered platforms. 

        For instance, Appalachian Trail long-distance hikers share their adventurous and emotional journey 
        through community blogs, necessitating an understanding of contributing factors to their emotions. 

        This project explores how social connections relate to hikers' emotional states amidst the uncertainties 
        of a dynamic socio-technical-natural system by leveraging AI-driven techniques and machine learning 
        algorithms on large-scale data.
