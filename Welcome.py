> *“Thousands of miles, countless steps, and a rollercoaster of emotions.”*

The Appalachian Trail is more than a physical journey—it's an emotional odyssey through forests, friendships, and fatigue. 
Long-distance hikers often share their stories online, posting blog entries that capture their mental highs and lows across the 2,190+ mile trek.

In this project, we explore how emotional well-being is shaped by **social interactions**, **geographical locations**, and **trail conditions**. 
By using **AI-driven sentiment analysis** on a decade of hiker journal entries, we uncover where hikers felt joy, where they struggled, 
and how “trail magic”—unexpected kindness—lifted spirits along the way.

        Emotional well-being is vital for individuals experiencing a life transition journey, 
        as it helps them maintain resilience, stay focused, and inform their decision-making. 

        Given the increasing integration of technology into everyday life, even in natural settings, 
        individuals share their experiences in online media, especially community-centered platforms. 

        For instance, Appalachian Trail long-distance hikers share their adventurous and emotional journey 
        through community blogs, necessitating an understanding of contributing factors to their emotions. 

        This project explores how social connections relate to hikers' emotional states amidst the uncertainties 
        of a dynamic socio-technical-natural system by leveraging AI-driven techniques and machine learning 
        algorithms on large-scale data.
