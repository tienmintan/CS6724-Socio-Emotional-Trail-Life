            - **Group Formations:** The animation shows hiker groups forming tightly at the beginning of the yearâ€”especially in southern regions like Georgiaâ€”then gradually dispersing northward. Some groups appear highly cohesive throughout the year, while others fragment or fade, which can be explained by dropouts, variable pace, or social drift.
            - **Geographical Consistency:** The movements closely trace the route from Georgia to Maine, confirming that the data aligns with the physical trail. Bottlenecks and slowdowns are visible near trail towns and popular rest points, suggesting logistical or social pauses.
            - **Group Size and Trail Progression:** Early in the season, some groups are large, dense, or both. However, over time, many hikers either speed ahead or lag behind, leading to sparse or vanished group representations by fall. Some groups make very erratic movements, large geographic jumps, or disappear mid-wayâ€”potentially highlighting diversions or logging inconsistencies.

            st.subheader("Use Cases:")
            st.markdown("""
            - **Trail Policy and Infrastructure Planning:** Park managers can identify when and where trail segments face the most pressure, helping prioritize shelter repairs, water resource checks, and waste management systems seasonally.
            - **Group Dynamics Analysis:** Behavioral researchers can use this visualization to examine how loosely or tightly human groups form and evolve in isolation, particularly in endurance activities.
            - **Emergency Response Training:** Rescue teams could use past data of group movement trends to simulate likely locations of missing hikers based on the time of the year and typical group movement paths.
